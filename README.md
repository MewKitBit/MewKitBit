## Ionut Alexandru O.M.
Name's Alex. I create the impossible we dream of.

- **MSc in Robotics & Systems** (Candidate)
- **BSc in Computer Engineering** (ETSISI UPM) - *Top 3 (8.2/10), 5x Honors Distinction*
- **BSc in IT Systems Engineering** (ETSISI UPM) - *Final Year*

I explore the messy middle intersection where software, hardware, science and art are one. I deal in robotics, mechatronics, embedded systems, simulation, computational science and edge computing.

I go where the real problems are, in cross-disciplinary environments where physics meets code, medicine meets robotics, where no single tag works. The best solutions come from forcing seemingly incompatible concepts to play nice together.

The modern landscape is often siloed to a fault, creating blind spots in innovation. Curiosity, creativity and the nerve to try are the missing driving factors. The universe does not draw clean borders, and the problems humanity faces today demand **V-shaped creators** who can navigate it.

*Interesting problems don’t belong to one discipline. Neither do I.*
## Field book
This is the place where a lot of what I do is recorded. You will find code that simulates, analyzes, makes things move, and whatever else I needed at the time.

I will not just throw things out, but build a comprehensive documentation body for ease of reference. Both for you, my esteemed reader, and for my own sanity.

It's a perpetual process. It's messy. It's complex. It works.
